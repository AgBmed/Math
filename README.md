# Math
Simple math file to use while learning C 

Added a Area of shapes file, which can determine the area of basic shapes like square, rectangle, and triangle
Trying out inputting from the terminal and using that input for avg calculation.

This is all just for my own playground, nothing here is really useful to anybody but myself. 

Thanks :)
